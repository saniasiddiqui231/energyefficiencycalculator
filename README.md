# Energy Efficiency Calculator

This is a simple energy efficiency calculator built using Python and Flask. The purpose of this project is to provide users with a tool to estimate and analyze energy efficiency based on certain input parameters.

The Energy Efficiency Calculator web app is a helpful tool that solves problems related to how we use energy. It helps us use our resources better, save money by using less energy, and be kinder to the environment. It's easy to use for everyone and can handle a lot of people using it at the same time. In a nutshell, this project is all about making it easier for everyone to save energy and money while being good to our planet.

This web app reads data from CSV files, shows you results, and makes graphs to help you understand energy efficiencies better. It gives you both numbers and pictures, making it easier to see how things are working. It's like a double feature – info and visuals – for a more complete understanding of energy efficiency.
